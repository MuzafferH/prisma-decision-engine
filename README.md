# PRISMA

**1,000 futures. One decision.**

Prisma is a decision intelligence engine that lets you see the consequences of your choices before committing. Powered by Monte Carlo simulation, Markov chains, and the Taleb fragility framework — all accessible through a conversation with Claude Code.

> Built for the "Built with Opus 4.6" Claude Code Hackathon, Feb 2026.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the folder with Claude Code: `claude`
3. Start talking: describe the decision you're facing

## The Crew

- **Carlo** — The Simulator. Runs 1,000 randomized futures using Monte Carlo simulation.
- **Markov** — The Oracle. Sees how states change through time using Markov chains.
- **Nassim** — The Judge. Classifies decisions as fragile, robust, or antifragile.
