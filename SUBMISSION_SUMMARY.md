PRISMA is a decision intelligence engine that makes Monte Carlo simulation accessible to anyone with a spreadsheet. Upload messy ops data — staffing logs, delivery metrics, cost reports — and PRISMA instantly builds interactive dashboards, surfaces hidden patterns and risks, and lets you simulate decisions before you commit.

Ask "What happens if I cut the fleet from 40 to 35 drivers?" and PRISMA runs 1,000 Monte Carlo futures, shows you probability distributions and sensitivity analysis, and gives a plain-language recommendation. Decision science that previously required a data scientist and a Python notebook, delivered in 60 seconds through a chat interface.

Built entirely with Claude Code and Opus 4.6 during the hackathon. Opus 4.6 powers the full reasoning chain: understanding messy data, generating structured tool_call specs, formulating statistically rigorous simulation parameters, and translating probabilistic outputs into actionable business advice. ~12K lines of vanilla JS. Client-side simulations — no data leaves your machine. Deployed on Vercel.

Built by a former Ops Manager who lived the problem.
